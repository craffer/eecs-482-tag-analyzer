# EECS 482 Git Tag Analyzer

Perform an analysis of git tags for EECS 482 projects to determine the amount of time a group spent coding a given project.

## Usage

Run `python3 analyzer.py GIT_REPO` using a link to a repo containing a tag for each compilation. The user must also have access to this repo. For example, for statistics on EECS 482 Project 2, the user would run:

```bash
python3 analyzer.py git@github.com:eecs482/uniqname1.uniqname2.uniqname3.2
```

The user must have Python 3.7 installed on their machine.
